2017 本科四年级的简历

通过 **海投** 简历，也就是说在网上投递，我获得了这些面试机会。

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/tXP4GgRE1N5RkXgYm4Fq8GN8DxkVzAiAns3H)

当人们寻找工作时，一般会选择在网上投递简历。但由于竞争激烈，海投也是效率最低的方法，然而我却凭借海投赢得了许多面试机会。

我是如何做到的？

在这篇文章中，我将逐行分析我的简历，目的如下：

-   解释我在制作简历时所做出的一系列选择
-   我为何相信这份简历会为我赢得诸多面试机会
-   你如何制作出更优质的简历！

因为第一次找工作时，我也挣扎了许久，所以我决定写下这篇文章。如果那时有人提供这样的简历指导，对当时的我来说将大有裨益。

文章组织结构如下：

1.  [**海投失败经验**][1]  \- 刚开始申请工作时的失败经历
2.  [**评估不同的选择：不断前进**][2]  \- 反思提高面试几率的不同策略
3.  [**举例：如何写出秒杀公司HR的个人简历**][3]  \- 我将从以下几个部分，逐步分析自己的简历

-   吸睛亮点
-   个人信息
-   联系方式
-   教育背景
-   工作经历
-   个人项目
-   个人技能

### 海投失败经验

#### 网上申请工作

你也许知道每家公司都会提供工作申请的链接。典型的求职网站会列举一系列的招聘信息，而直到你打开链接、阅读岗位描述和岗位最小要求时，都认为自己完全可以胜任这些工作。

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/ZkNlrY5IYpz2bv2jQW33DyeetxaqDWzZBxYG)

谷歌招聘界面

以下是一则招聘启事，工作描述中有一大串单词，你或许从未听说过，或许可能听说过，或许希望自己曾经听说过。页面最底端还有一个可怜无辜的 **申请**键。

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/M5wN8EB3bR8qnxaVb8BdNL8yEqoAsGHzcOq6)

谷歌某招聘岗位描述

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0ZrZYFRkruNTX4kLJDF4BEQikiPvAnVSXds0)

尽管不太确定，你还是觉得自己能够胜任，因为你想得到这份工作。

所以你填写申请表，按下**提交**按钮————期待得到面试通知。

你可能会得到以下结果：

1.  电话面试？（哇！有可能会得到这份工作！！！）
2.  马上被拒绝？（该死, 从头再来吧）
3.  石沉大海？(天哪，至少要礼貌性地拒绝我一下吧)

#### 继续海投，等待成功......这样做对吗？

遗憾的是，大部分人在找工作或实习时都会走上这样的道路。


提交几次工作申请，被拒绝或石沉大海。继续申请工作，继续被拒绝或石沉大海。就这样一直重复又重复。

我们为什么要这样对自己呢？我们不断花费时间做重复性工作，却一遍又一遍得到同样的、令人失望的结果。

因为所有人都在这样做，对吗？因为我们至少在朝着正确的方向前进，有一丁点希望，对吗？你觉得其他人是如何得到面试机会的？

### 评估不同的选择: 不断前进

> “毫无疑问，挫折与失败是成功路上的两大垫脚石。”
>   
> \- 戴尔·卡耐基, （《如何赢得朋友和影响他人》作者）

我们可以用以下两种方式来解决这个问题：

1.  以显微镜视角观察自己的申请/简历
2.  质疑自己寻求面试机会的过程

这篇文章将聚焦于前者，因为不管你以何种方式寻求面试机会， **事实上每家公司都会以简历作为评估依据**。因此，我们将以显微镜视角来观察我的简历，从而学会如何制作出色的简历。

海投简历十分具有挑战性，因为你的简历被人事经理看到之前会历经很多步骤。

简历首先会经过  [线上关键词筛选][4], 然后招聘专员会花费 6 秒查看简历，最后人事经理审阅简历，决定你是否值得他安排面试。

然后，尽管困难重重，我还是通过网上申请获得了面试机会。**我是怎么做到的？**  _试错_。从大学二年级到现在，我便申请了数百个软件工程师的职位。

当我开始申请的时候，我被拒绝了很多次，但是随着时间流逝，我学会了如何去适应。当我四年级时就已经十分成功，几乎每次都能赢得面试机会。

帮助我赢得面试机会的简历  **就是**  文章开头的那份简历。

我花了  **四年时间**  不断重复，亲身测试才走到这一步。根据经验，我提出了几个 **简历创作准则**  来帮助你写出甚至更出色的软件岗求职简历。这些准则帮助我得到了心仪的工作，也能帮助你找到自己喜欢的工作。

尽管这花费了我 **四年** 时间，但你们却不需要经受这样，因为你能在此时、此地学习到这些准则。

我的目标是解答你们所有关于软件工程师求职的问题。这样，你们就不必为了制作出色的简历，花费大量的时间在谷歌上搜索和交叉参考。

你们可以利用自己的宝贵时间，更好地制作出秒杀一切公司的简历。

所以，现在开始阅读这篇文章吧。从我的经验中汲取精华，开始一步步探索我的简历吧！

### 举例：如何写出秒杀公司HR的个人简历

> “方法可以有一百万种或更多许多，但原则只有几个。抓住原则的人可以有效地选择自己的方法，而尝试方法但忽略原则的人，一定会遇到问题。”

> \- 拉尔夫·瓦尔多·爱默生

让我们再看一眼简历吧:

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/vbkZAcOy2IDkqyI6OgaCCsIBurgUf2muRpOg)

简历: 高亮重点

#### 吸睛亮点

#### 一页简历

招聘专员不会花费一整天来阅读你的简历。他们平均会花费 6 秒来看简历。 要把简历写得  **简单**  和  **精确**。

#### 内容 （标题, 教育背景, 工作经历, 软件项目, 个人技能）

按照 **优先级** 从上到下布局内容。对于求职软件工程师的人来说，一定要写明 “[个人项目][5]”。

#### 布局内容保持一致

确保每部分的内容形式一致。这非常重要，因为这会增加可读性。**可读性**  非常重要。

所以，为什么这份简历成功了呢？让我们来探索一下重点内容吧！

#### Who Are You (1)

_Target Audience: Anyone writing a_ résumé

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/GsXc3z0q67DOrLEthtEv-zbeaHCsZiclXM2H)

Résumé: Name Section

Starting off real easy. Your name. Place your name at the top of your résumé in a  **large legible font.**

No need to be all fancy about it with extravagant colors or fancy fonts. Plain and simple does the trick. You want the recruiter to see this easily from a mile away because you want them to know who you are. A recruiter who has to do minimum work is a happy recruiter. A happy recruiter is one who is more likely to give you an interview.

**Recap:**  Make it ridiculously easy for the recruiter to read and find your name.

#### Contact Information (2)

_Target Audience: Anyone writing a résumé_

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/8diam7KWW7-wDoFqyq5PZroeZcjNtFL6--5N)

Résumé: Contact Section

Your contact info should be as easy as identifying your name. This is so important. Of all the things in the world,  **please do not mess this one up**  because how else on earth will the recruiter contact you?

**Recap:**  Put in the correct contact information or you’ll never be contacted.

#### Education (3)

_Target Audience: Anyone writing a résumé with a degree_

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/4bIZG1Lqw-H3zIQXMHrOjtS1yJQYFhOnI6DD)

Résumé: Education Section: Header Subsection

If you are attending or attended college, this should be the first section of your résumé, because going to college is a huge accomplishment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only “66.7 percent of 2017 high school graduates age 16 to 24 enrolled in colleges or universities”. So be proud of it and include it!

Right off the bat, this tells the recruiter that you are invested in education and learning, which is crucial because technology is continuously changing. Furthermore, this information serves as an indicator of your successes, so be sure to put it down.

**Recap:**  Put down where you got educated.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/4L6mOPdolMGbeEt6u4ZkdFI3NA762HMtoQfS)

Résumé: Education Section: Coursework Subsection

Be sure to include  **relevant**  coursework corresponding to the position that you are applying for. While a course on the  _History of Italian Gastronomy_  sounds exceptionally appetizing, it doesn’t have a place in a résumé that is trying to get you a job in computer science.

This will significantly improve the ability of the recruiter and the hiring manager looking at your résumé in deciding whether you are a good fit for the position. And as previously mentioned, a happy recruiter is more likely to give you an interview.

**Recap:**  Only include relevant coursework.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/JjXDrEy8HfZPFHGhUKmjJBvoNS1Jw5IY9Z4W)

Résumé: Education Section: GPA Subsection

Okay. GPA. Before we talk about this, let’s remind ourselves of the main purpose of a résumé.

The main purpose of a résumé is to highlight your knowledge, skills, and accomplishments succinctly. You want to include things on your résumé that you are proud of, but also things that will impress. You want to paint a picture of yourself in the best light possible so that recruiters and hiring managers want to interview you.

Now back to your GPA. It should be fairly obvious whether or not your GPA is impressive. If your GPA is below a 3.0, don’t put it on your résumé. There’s nothing wrong with excluding your GPA from your résumé if it only harms your chances.

If you have a GPA between 3.0–3.2, this is a judgment call. From personal experience, I have talked to some companies that require a minimum GPA of 3.2, but these were primarily financial or quantitative companies. Most software companies have little regard for your GPA. If you have anything above a 3.2, I would place it on your résumé.

If you have a low GPA, fear not, as this gives you the opportunity to be creative! My overall GPA was a 3.2 due to poor grades from my freshman engineering prerequisites and humanities classes. But once I finished and started taking courses within my major, my in-major GPA (GPA calculated from courses in my major) was a 3.44, which was significantly higher. So that’s what I put down (but make sure to qualify it as a departmental GPA).

There are many ways of going about presenting yourself in the best light possible, even when it may seem like the odds are stacked against you. I only provided one example of accomplishing this, but there are many more ways waiting to be discovered by you. Fully embrace your failures and accomplishments because they make up who are you. Be honest and truthful, and always focus on highlighting the best parts about yourself.

**Recap:**  Your GPA does not define you. The purpose of your résumé is to present yourself in the best light. Never forget that! Be creative when going about this and DON’T LIE.

#### Employment (4)

_Target Audience: Students with software engineering work experience_

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/E4nwBSH6QdNW0QEfUp1CC9Tls1PwrudxV9I1)

Résumé: Employment Section

If you are a college student without any experience, don’t be afraid! This was my senior year résumé when I was applying for a full-time job. I was fortunate enough to have accumulated relevant work experience from summer internships, but this isn’t absolutely necessary to get an interview. If you find that you don’t have much to put in section, jump down to the ‘[Personal Projects][6]’ section.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/8Kbx5ZwLw89g32ypd2QJWEZhOWCttMkuV7-D)

Résumé: Employment Section: Header Subsection

While it is great to have past work experience, not all work experience is treated equally when it comes to looking for a job in software engineering. Focus only on including work experience that has  _relevance_  to the job that you are applying for. For instance, if you have experience working as a cashier in retail or a waiter in the food industry, don’t include it! Unfortunately, your abilities to handle money or serve food did not provide any indication that you will succeed as a software engineer.

A recruiter’s goal is to match candidates with jobs that fit the candidates’ skill sets. Therefore it is essential only to include past work experience that has some relation to the position that you are currently applying to, on your résumé.

Part of accomplishing this means creating a collection of various résumés, each tailored specifically for the different job that you are interested in. This is analogous to the college application process, where you had to write separate essays for each university that you applied to. Each college has its own values, culture, and vision, making it nearly impossible to write a generic, one-size-fits-all college essay. Therefore, tailor your résumé to the job that you are applying for.

Lastly, a note on dates. Order your experiences in descending order starting with your most recent experiences. For undergraduates, this means being mindful of including experiences that are both recent and relevant. Sadly, no one cares about whatever accomplishments you had in middle school or high school. If the experience is outdated, leave it out.

**Recap:**  Have various versions of your résumé tailored for each job you are applying for. There is no one-size-fits-all résumé.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/bby7lJQKFQiQo86Zdz4K0w3NUO4pg9Bc1yCj)

Résumé: Employment Section: Description Subsection

The hardest part about résumé writing is having descriptions that fully encapsulate your accomplishments from past work experiences in a meaningful and impressive way.

What does it mean for your descriptions to be meaningful and impressive? It means getting the recruiter to think: “This is someone that has the skill sets we are looking for. This is someone that has made a significant impact in their past jobs. This is someone we would like to interview and potentially hire.”

**The primary objective of the Employment section is to show the impact and value that you had while working at an established institution.**  Your goal is to show recruiters that you are a candidate that can get things done and do them well.

To best showcase my accomplishments in my résumé, I adopted the following powerful formula, created by the Former SVP of People Operations at Google, Laszlo Bock:

> “Accomplished \[X\] as measured by \[Y\] by doing \[Z\]” — Laszlo Bock

You can see this very clearly in the very first bullet point of this section on my résumé.

**Improved device’s battery lifespan by 8% by integrating a fuel gauge sensor and establishing a battery saving state**

Let’s break it down:

**Accomplished \[X\]-** Improved device’s battery lifespan

**Measured by \[Y\]-**  by 8%

**By Doing \[Z\]-** integrating a fuel gauge sensor and establishing a battery saving state

I leveraged this formula in some shape or form in almost every sentence in my résumé.

To help you along this process, below is a word bank of excellent verbs you can and should use:

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/08UNCYv26D5hz87HF-XkHIzD-G1PBj6X0PsE)

Verb Wordbank

Here are some examples of fill-in the blank sentences that I have come up with for you to get started:

-   Reduced \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_.
-   Redesigned \_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_.
-   Implemented \_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_.
-   Improved \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_ through \_\_\_\_\_.
-   Utilized \_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_.
-   Increased \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_ through \_\_\_\_\_.
-   Integrated \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_.
-   Incorporated \_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_.

**Recap:** Use the “Accomplished \[X\] as measured by \[Y\] by doing \[Z\]” formula. It’s the most effective and most apparent way of showing recruiters/managers your impact.

Résumé: Employment Section: Leveraged Knowledge Subsection

Lastly, I end each work experience with a  **leveraged knowledge** bullet point. The utility behind this last bit is it enables the reader to really get a sense of the technology I am familiar with by explicitly stating the technologies that I used for the project.

This also allows me to have a concise, but clean ‘Skills’ section located at the bottom of my résumé. Recruiters can then look at the bottom to immediately obtain a sense of my capabilities by seeing which computer languages I am familiar with. If they are looking to see if I have specific knowledge in a particular tool, framework, or library, then they can find this out by looking at my projects.

**Recap:** Including technologies that you used in your descriptions will help you bypass online keyword filters when applying online. This will also give recruiters a clearer idea of your experiences and knowledge.

#### Personal Projects (5)

_Target Audience: Students looking for software engineering internships/full-time positions + Unique section for software engineering applicants_

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/nCBs3pSsOJXgmHD2RlcBnC33Ubg5iv5oqO-6)

Résumé: Personal Projects Section

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/Zn4RfnPXLAYJ89knNQro7XZcTVAP-MDeOuI2)

Maybe if I say it enough times, you will understand the importance of this section,  **especially for those that do not have work experience**.

> Personal projects are integral to piquing recruiters and hiring managers interest as it shows you are passionate about programming.

A personal project can be anything programming related, whether it be a Python script, Java program, web page, mobile application, etc. These projects show that you are genuinely interested in computer science and you have strong desires to work as a software engineer because you are willing to go beyond your schoolwork and create something on your own.

Taking the initiative to build something on your own is extremely impressive. It shows that you are dedicated to expanding your knowledge of computer science and that you are not afraid of putting in the extra work to do so. Ultimately, it is a fantastic way to demonstrate self-initiative and genuine interest in this field.

The other benefit of doing personal projects is that you inevitably gain the skills that apply to work in the real world. Things that you don’t usually do at school, but you will do at work such as using standard frameworks/libraries, understanding full-stack web development, creating mobile applications, setting up a development environment, or programming efficiently with Vim.

> **Tip:**  Create a personal website that showcases and documents all of your personal projects. This is a little hack that ‘virtually extends’ your résumé beyond the one-page limit.

To reiterate one last time, personal projects show your passion and dedication towards developing the necessary skills need for a job that you don’t yet have. This is a  **must-have**  on any software engineering resume.

> “Build some iPhone apps, web apps, whatever! Honestly it doesn’t matter that much what you’re building as long as you’re building something. You can build a fairly meaty project in one weekend. This means that with about 3–4 weekends of work, you can make your résumé go from so-so to fantastic. Seriously — I’ve seen lots of people do this.”  
>   
> \- Gayle McDowell, former Google Engineer and Author of Cracking the Coding Interview

If there is a specific company that you  **really**  want to work at, one of the best ways to stand out is doing a personal project that is directly related to the job that you are applying for.

I got my internship at Autodesk by taking a free online interactive computer graphics course on Udacity. The course taught me to use a JavaScript library called  _three.js_, and it just so happened that there was a software engineering internship opening at Autodesk looking for someone with full-stack website and knowledge in  _three.js_  (aka ME).

A word of caution on this technique. This strategy is not perfect. This only really works for companies like Autodesk which do not have generalized software engineering internships like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. When starting off early in your career, it is better to generalize and figure out the different disciplines of computer science. Nonetheless, this is an excellent method worth trying if there is a specific company you want.

**Recap:** Personal projects are imperative. If you haven’t already, start NOW! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

#### Skills (6)

_Target Audience: Anyone looking for a software engineering job_

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/pBtpGQVtzxV6QQO7HunfI9JIJFvwTZvVTS9B)

Résumé: Skill Section

The title explains it all. Keep this section dumb, simple, and clean. List all the relevant skills that you want the recruiter to know you have. The more skills you have listed here that match key technical words in the qualification section of the job description, the better your chances!

This will allow you to bypass the online keyword scanner easily.  **However, this is not a fool-proof method of circumventing the scanner.**  Ultimately it is a recruiter who gets their hands on your résumé that decides, but they will also be more inclined to give you an interview if they see you as a good fit for the job!

A thing to note about the skills section is to NOT simply list all the keywords on the job description just for the sake of showing you’re a good fit. It will come back to bite you as you will be questioned on the skills you claim to know.

Part of giving yourself some leeway in this is including an indication of your proficiency level. Since you are probably not practicing every language you’ve ever encountered on a day to day basis, including a proficiency level can help the recruiter know your strongest languages at a moment in time and other languages that you are familiar with.

I’ve opted to use two tiers:

1.  **Proficient** \- Languages that I am very familiar with, feel very comfortable using, and can interview with right now.
2.  **Familiar**  \- Languages that I have utilized in the past but may not be as knowledgeable in currently, but can pick back up given time.

Other valid options include:

1.  Advanced
2.  Intermediate
3.  Basic

or

1.  Expert
2.  Advanced
3.  Intermediate

or

1.  Fluent
2.  Proficient
3.  Familiar

or

1.  Working Knowledge
2.  Basic Knowledge

**Recap:**  When applying for a specific job online, cross-reference the job description and add essential technical keywords on your résumé to increase your chance of getting an interview.

### Key Takeaways

-   Make sure your name and contact information is correct and legible
-   Be sure to include your education. If your GPA is low, leave it out or be creative!
-   Utilize the “Accomplished \[X\] as measured by \[Y\] by doing \[Z\]” formula to effectively show the impact that you had in your past employment
-   Do personal projects — especially if you do not have past experience working in tech

### Final Thoughts

While this résumé got me interviews at numerous software engineering companies, there is no guarantee that following all the principles and techniques I have explained here will yield the same results for you.

This was my senior year résumé in 2017. It is a showcase of my journey and interest in software engineering. Copying it will do you no good, as technology is constantly evolving and the talent search is an ever-changing process. Instead, use this as a reference.

Use my résumé and this article as a resource to become a better résumé writer and a more effective communicator. Focus on learning how to best convey your skills and achievements to others. This in itself is an invaluable, lifelong skill that you will need wherever you go.

As you write your résumé, please remember — be yourself!

Your résumé is a list of  **your**  own accomplishments, achievements, and interests. Your goal is to craft the most polished version of yourself. Lastly, have fun and enjoy the process!

For anyone interested in using this resume template, I obtained it from [CareerCup][7]which was founded by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, author of  _Cracking The Coding Interview_.

From personal experience, what’s  **most important**  is the content. The resume writing principles discussed above can be applied to any template!
